Combining sentiment scores with rating scores from reviews, we hope to build out a super score that better reflects a user's overall experience and feeling towards a restaurant. This super score will be used in our **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System.**\n","\n","This project will also incorporate **Topic Modelling (LDA)** to further classify text reviews based on several dominant topics. By identfying common key words in different dominant topics, we will use these key words in our **Content Based Recommendation System.**\n","\n","Lastly, this project will use the longitude and
